		<h3> Prototype 1 </h3>
		<p>Making 3D minigames proved to be very challenging because of the limited resources online. Even when I have a few ideas of the minigame. I was not able to translate it into unity3D.
			<br>
			I made a TicTacToe from a Youtube tutorial to learn how to integrate algorithms into unity. But it being a two-player game means I might have to tweak the code to make the second player the computer.
			<br>
			Another game I made is called Bridge Game, inspired from the one in Squid Games, the Netflix Show.
			What really helped me in this process is my Computer Science background to code in C#, it's new to me but similar to C++, also breaking down games into algorithms and cracking logic.
		</p>
		<h3> Prototype 2 </h3>
		<p>At this point I felt making a terrain to walk into is the most tie-able part of the game.
			I used a unity asset called “Lowpoly Village Asset” and imported its components into my game.
			At this point I’m also thinking about the feel of walking through this space.
		</p>
		<h3> Prototype 3 </h3>
		<p>Merging the scenes and games together.
			At this stage I also tried to convert the Two player TicTacToe to single player against the computer but it wasn’t working so I decided to drop it. Eventually having only two mini games. <br>

		</p>
		<h3> Prototype 4 </h3>
		<p>I realised merging scenes was a big mistake because They wouldn’t load one after another and Game Manager wasn’t working fine. So I separated the scenes again and used Scene manager for loading between scenes. I even added a loading animation
			and sound which also didn’t work the way I imagined.
			Following are some screenshots of the game of how it would look in colorblind modes.

	<h3>Reflections</h3>
	As much as I wanted to follow through my game proposal I wasn't able to fulfill my goal. As much as that feels like a failure, it is a big learning experience. It was fun and I keep getting new ideas for it and I wish to make it in a VR space where this simulation feels more concrete. Getting basic functionality to work was very challenging and Unity has its own glitches. I almost laugh when I realise how I had to cut down on the applications due to the constraints of time and skills, it makes me emphatically look at the existing tech industry. I feel like this problem can be tackled with proper agencies and training/information sessions.
