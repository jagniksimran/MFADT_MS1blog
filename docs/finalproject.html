		<h3> Prototype 1 </h3>
		<p>Making 3D minigames proved to be very challenging because of the limited resources online. Even when I have a few ideas of the minigame. I was not able to translate it into unity3D.
			<br>
			I made a TicTacToe from a Youtube tutorial to learn how to integrate algorithms into unity. But it being a two-player game means I might have to tweak the code to make the second player the computer.
			<br>
			Another game I made is called Bridge Game, inspired from the one in Squid Games, the Netflix Show.
			What really helped me in this process is my Computer Science background to code in C#, it's new to me but similar to C++, also breaking down games into algorithms and cracking logic.
		</p>
		<h3> Prototype 2 </h3>
		<p>At this point I felt making a terrain to walk into is the most tie-able part of the game.
			I used a unity asset called “Lowpoly Village Asset” and imported its components into my game.
			At this point I’m also thinking about the feel of walking through this space.
		</p>
		<h3> Prototype 3 </h3>
		<p>Merging the scenes and games together.
			At this stage I also tried to convert the Two player TicTacToe to single player against the computer but it wasn’t working so I decided to drop it. Eventually having only two mini games. <br>

		</p>
		<h3> Prototype 4 </h3>
		<p>I realised merging scenes was a big mistake because They wouldn’t load one after another and Game Manager wasn’t working fine. So I separated the scenes again and used Scene manager for loading between scenes. I even added a loading animation
			and sound which also didn’t work the way I imagined.
			Following are some screenshots of the game of how it would look in colorblind modes.

	<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>	As much as I wanted to follow through my game proposal I wasn't able to fulfill my goal. As much as that feels like a failure, it is a big learning experience.
Focusing on smaller aspects rather than big ones. Getting basic functionality to work was very challenging and Unity has its own glitches. I almost laugh when I realise how I had to cut down on the applications due to the constraints of time and skills, it makes me emphatically look at existing tech industry. I feel like this problem can be tackled with proper agencies and training/information sessions.
Although this project won't go for my MS2, I will definitely work on it because it was a fun experience and I keep getting new ideas for it and I wish to make it in a VR space where this simulation feels more concrete.
<ol>
<li>a. What are the specific questions you are attempting to answer in your prototypes?
	<br> I'm trying to understand how different hurdles to accessiblity translate in the technology we use, mainly focused on vision impairments using glitch and color blind modes. I also try to understand how having a character which is human or non binary humanoid changes the narrative of the game.   </li>
<br><li>b. What are the strengths of your project?
	<br> The learnings from this experience has been the most impactful things. Creating a functional game in such a small time is a big accomplihmnt for me.
		Creating a space that forces us to look around us and realise life for other people and how different everything looks.
	Learning Unity Engine and C# using this project gives me a good perspective on game development.   </li>
<br><li>c. What are the most critical issues for your project?
	<br> Not being able to fully accommodte my game proposal with all the different abilities makes the game feel very unfinished.
	The effects applied to the game don't show up because of technical limitations.
	There are more layers to understanding why and how this game will impact one's views.
During User Testing, the game objective wasn't easy to understand until the written text came up. It was also not easy to understand the second part of the game and winning objective.  </li>
<br><li>d. What can you do to address these issues, and to solidify the strengths?
	<br> Conceptualising the game further would definately make it more impactful, because in my user testing I found that the game motive wasn't clear to them.
Developing the game with more user based flow and better unity skills would make it successful. It also neds better technology to be used.</li>
<br><li>e. What new questions do you have?
	<br> <ul><li>How this project will help the cause and to what extent?</li>
	<li>Can empathy be invoked with just the help of a game play?</li>
<li>What other senses can be engaged for betterment of game play?</li>
<li>How can this approach be used to make Accesible Technology better?</li>
<li>What different media can make this project more successful?</li></ul></li>
<br><li>f. How has this prototype allowed you to engage in your goals within this program? Does this feel like a possible future direction?
	<br>This prototype has helped in understanding the design process as compared to software development process. It not only gave me an oppurtunity to learn design thinking but also game development and unity.
My goal for this program is to experiment with different forms of making using technology, and this making this game felt exactly like that. I'm happy to think more about game development and critical design.</li>
